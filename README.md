# iOS Project with VIPER Architecture

## Overview

This repository contains a demo iOS project created using the VIPER architecture and View Code. VIPER is a design pattern that promotes a clean, modular, and testable approach to iOS app development. This project is designed to showcase the VIPER architecture and serve as learning purposes and a starting point for future projects.

In this project, I've used JSONPlaceholder as a data mocking service to simulate interactions with external data sources.

The project also includes localization for English and Portuguese (PT-BR) using String Catalog. String Catalog simplifies the process of translating and adapting your app's content for different languages.
